# Smart Home Motion-Based Lighting System

This project demonstrates an automated smart home lighting system
designed using Arduino and simulated in Tinkercad.

## Features
- Motion-based automatic lighting (PIR sensor)
- Automatic light turn-off after inactivity
- Manual override button
- Simulated bedtime shutoff
- Warm white RGB lighting (255, 245, 205)

## Tinkercad Simulation
The full, runnable Tinkercad simulation can be accessed here:

## Repository Contents
- Arduino source code
- Circuit diagram export
- Project explanation report

## Notes
Due to Tinkercad being cloud-based, the project is shared using a public
link to allow full inspection and simulation.
