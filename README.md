# Smart Home Motion-Based Lighting System

This project implements a smart home lighting system using an Arduino,
a PIR motion sensor, an override button, and an RGB LED.

## Features
- Motion-based automatic lighting
- Auto-off after inactivity
- Manual override button
- Simulated bedtime shutoff
- Warm white RGB lighting (255, 245, 205)

## Notes
Due to Tinkercad being cloud-based, the project is shared via a public 
link to allow full inspection and simulation.
